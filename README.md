# CyberCafe Landing Project

Welcome to the CyberCafe project, a comprehensive web solution built with React, designed to provide an immersive and user-friendly experience to gaming and tech enthusiasts.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## 🚀 Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## 🌐 Localization

The application utilizes i18n to support multiple languages. Ensure translations are updated within the respective JSON files located in the public/locales directory.

## 🎨 Styling

This project utilizes [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for utility-first CSS styling. Tailwind CSS allows for rapid UI development with its concise and powerful syntax.

This project also utilizes FontAwesome icons. Icons are imported and utilized within components using the FontAwesomeIcon component.
